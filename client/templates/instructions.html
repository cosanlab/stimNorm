	<h3 align = "center">Background</h3>
	<blockquote class = "instr">
		To provide you with some context, please note that these conversations occurred during an online game that these individuals were playing. Each game consisted of 6 people who were making a series of decisions about how many points they wanted to keep for themselves versus share with the entire group from a total of 100 possible points; these points were later converted to dollars and cents and paid to each indivdual. The game consisted of 10 rounds and each message exchange took place during one round. Individuals were able to see each the decisions made by other people in the game and were free to say anything they like in their messages. To help them recognize each other individuals were given avatars of different animals, specifically a: bee, bird, cat, cow, lion or pig.<br><br>
		On the next page we will explain the message lables we would like you to use when completing this HIT.
